This application will allow you to draw ovals and rectangles. Select the shape that will
be drawn and choose an outline and fill colour for the shape. Enter a stroke width and draw
the shape using your mouse. You may remove the last drawn shape with the undo button and
when you want to start with new canvas, click the clear button.
